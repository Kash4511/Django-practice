This repository is dedicated to experimenting with and deepening my knowledge of Django. It serves as a space where I can explore various Django features and concepts, from models and views to templates and authentication. The projects in this repository are designed to help me apply theoretical learning and test out different functionalities in real-world scenarios. Each experiment helps me build my skills and understanding of Django while working on practical, hands-on projects.
